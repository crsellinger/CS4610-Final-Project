# CS4610-Final-Project
Final project for CS4610. Based in Unity2020.3.4f

Update week #1: Setup Unity project, created 3d terrain mesh and added procedural generation using Perlin noise.

Update week #1.2: Created simple third person camera and player model. **Note: hold left alt while in game mode to move camera and not player, otherwise
camera and player rotate together**

refresh: testing push upstream and zip download to local machine

Update week #2.1: Added collider for terrain mesh

Update week #2.2: Added more natural terrain, updated player coordinates to spawn on mesh (hardcoded), couldn't figure out how to dynamically spawn

Update week #2.3: Added procedually generated game objects.

Update week #3.1: Added tree game objects to Scene. Added colliders, shaders, and material to game objects. Added material to terrain.

Update week #3.2: Added dynamic player spawn, Finished terrain generation (previous code was always the same position of noise map, now it looks different everytime you spawn in). I think this is our final update before due date.
